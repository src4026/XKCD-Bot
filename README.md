*‚ùó This repository is not planned to be further developed and will stay as an **inactive project**.*

## Usage
This repository is just a connection between [the Replit repository on which the bot is hosted (my personal use)](https://replit.com/@src4026/XKCD-Bot) and not meant for the best flexibility and documentation for the people wanting to use this. If you want to try it for yourself, do so **AT YOUR OWN RISK**.

## Credits

I originally began this project but went into maintenance mode shortly after. While the project was on hiatus, [GreenBlob](https://replit.com/@lightboxfacts) made a fork of the project and worked on it to resolve persistent issues. The current project is derived from his [second repository for the bot](https://replit.com/@lightboxfacts/XKCD-Bot2).

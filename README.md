## Credits

I originally began this project but went into maintenance mode due to various reasons. While the project was on hiatus, [GreenBlob](https://replit.com/@lightboxfacts) made a fork of the project and worked on it to resolve persistent issues. Parts of this project are derived from his [second repository for the bot](https://replit.com/@lightboxfacts/XKCD-Bot2).
